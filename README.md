# OOP concepts in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

Welcome!! Yes, you heard it right. This repository(currently little) is mainly created as my go-to reference guide for basic(you can consider naive) level to advance level in OOP concepts in ruby.

## You didn't like something!/I didn't do something right!

Please file an [issue](https://github.com/suryart/ruby_concepts/issues) and we'll see how we can fix it. If you didn't like something then we'll surely correct the mistake and sort it out.

## Why? Who? What?

Because [Object-oriented Programming(OOP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is a well known programming paradigm and can be achieved in many languages. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is one them. As we all know, everything is an object in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

[I](https://github.com/suryart), I love learning new stuff, seriously, that's what I do all the time!

This is just a guide which I(and you could too) find helful and a go-to reference on OOP concepts and implementations in Ruby.
